"High scores are arguably an extraneous part of a sudoku game, but they seem "
"like fun, so <application>GNOME Sudoku</application> includes them. The "
"algorithm for high scores gives you points for speed and for puzzle "
"difficulty and takes away points for using hints. The algorithm is designed "
"to give reasonable-looking scores, but it sometimes produces negative "
"scores, which can be upsetting for users."
