2008-02-02  Thomas Hinkle  <tmhinkle@gmail.com>

	* src/lib/main.py (UI.you_win_callback): Make sudoku grid have
	silly animation when we win.

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py (GridDancer): Add silly sudoku animations to
	make victory feel more victorious!

	* src/lib/defaults.py.in Allow defaults to be run in-place if
	gnome_sudoku module has not yet been loaded by anyone (allows
	testing of individual modules)

2008-02-02  Thomas Hinkle  <tmhinkle@gmail.com>

	* src/lib/defaults.py.in (PUZZLE_DIR): Add PUZZLE_DIR parameter to
	point to where default starter puzzles are stored.
	* src/lib/sudoku_maker.py (SudokuMaker.load): Use PUZZLE_DIR from
	defaults to load puzzles (fixes in-place running of gnome-sudoku).
	(SudokuMaker.get_puzzles): Add parameter 'exclude' which is a list
	of puzzles not to include in results. This allows caller to exclude
	saved games (which SudokuMaker doesn't know about)
	* src/lib/game_selector.py (NewOrSavedGameSelector.make_new_game_model):
	Exclude saved games from list of new games.

2008-01-16  Thomas Mills Hinkle  <tmhinkle@gmail.com>

	type=gtk.WINDOW_POPUP instead of crazy abuse of hints &c.
	This fixes bug #479938

2008-01-12  Thomas H.P. Andersen  <phomes@gmail.com>

	* src/gnome-sudoku.in.in: Reorder to load from prefix before system 
	wide. Fixes bug #406672.

2008-01-10  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/gnome-sudoku.in:
	* src/gnome-sudoku.in.in:
	* src/lib/defaults.py.in: Allow Sudoku to be run from source
	distribution, without requiring a full install. To run Sudoku
	from the source distribution, simply execute:
	$ python gnome-sudoku/src/gnome-sudoku

2008-01-08  Thomas Mills HInkle  <tmhinkle@gmail.com>

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Use add_value_to_ui for all
	callbacks where we restore user values to the grid (whether
	through loading saved game or undo). (Bug #430893)
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gsudoku.py Use add_value_to_ui for all
	callbacks where we restore user values to the grid (whether
	through loading saved game or undo). (Bug #430893)

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py:
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/game_selector.py:
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/timer.py: Make new strings translatable. Patch
        by Didier Vidal. (Bug #502194)

2007-11-21  Thomas Mills HInkle  <thinkle@gnome.org>

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku.py Don't print tracebacks -- just
	warn about invalid lines.
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku_maker.py Ignore invalid lines in
	puzzle files.

2007-11-20  Thomas Mills HInkle  <thinkle@gnome.org>

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/simple_debug.py Add walk-through option to step through code.
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Fix error that made
	status-bar not update after 1st puzzle played.
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/game_selector.py Add debug
	statements. Speed up make_new_game_model substantially by calling
	get_puzzles() rather than get_new_puzzle() -- the real solution
	here is to improve the algorithm in get_new_puzzle or eliminate
	it, but this is a quick fix.
	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku.py Speed up is_valid_puzzle -- we
	now do a really simple test to make sure we actually have a list
	of 81 integers.

2007-11-08  Thomas H.P. Andersen  <phomes@gmail.com>

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gsudoku.py: Fix calculation of big/small borders.

	sudoku files.

2007-10-29  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku_maker.py: Keep generated puzzles in
	plain text files, with one file per difficulty level, rather than
	in one giant pickle. Remove "names" (what did the names mean
	anyway?).

	Organize module into two sections -- "methods for
	accessing puzzles we've created" and "methods for creating new
	puzzles". The methods for accessing have changed substantially
	(and changed names), resulting in changes throughout
	gnome-sudoku. The methods for generating puzzles have changed only
	slightly, with writes to files replacing holding things in memory,
	but the method names etc. staying the same.

	Remove SudokuTracker from this module to the module saver,
	reflecting it's new role (saving games rather than holding all
	games ever played in memory).

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py:

	inactivate_new_game_etc - decorator now returns whatever the
	wrapped function returns.

	disable "Save", "Open", "ByHand", "HighScore" menu items.

	Remove "Clear" and "Clear Notes" from toolbar.

	Add gconf key auto_save_interval (default to 60) -- interval
	between autosaves in seconds.

	UI.__init__ - reorganize into various setup_* functions for
	greater clarity. New methods are: setup_gui, setup_main_window,
	setup_actions, setup_undo, setup_color, setup_autosave,
	setup_main_boxes, setup_by_hand_area, setup_toggles

	UI.start_worker_thread - make use of new sudoku_maker convenience
	method n_puzzles to count puzzles.

	UI.you_win_callback - disable high scores and display simple dialog.

	UI.new_cb - use new "select game" interface (for opening game or
	new game).

	UI.quit_cb - save unfinished puzzle on quit

	UI.save_game - use new saver.sudoku_tracker saving

	UI.autosave - method to autosave, called on a gobject.timeout

	GamesTracker - remove stub class that has no use.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku_thumber.py: Create module to draw
	pretty thumbnails of sudoku.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/colors.py: color_hex_to_float - Add a
	convenience method to allow us to turn html colors into gtk color
	tuples. This makes it more convenient to follow tango guidelines
	from their website.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/gtk_goodies/dialog_extras.py:
	UserCancelledError exception type for convient catching of user
	cancellations of dialogs.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/game_selector.py:

	_compareGameNames - Deleted - no need for this function any more.

	color_from_difficulty - Added function to conveniently generate
	color-coding for difficulties for out gameselector thumbnails.

	NewOrSavedGameSelector - Create new Selector to allow user to
	select either a new or used game in one, simple package. This will
	replace the NewGameSelector and the OldGameSelector

	NewGameSelector - delete
	OldGameSelector - delete
	HighScores - delete

	GamePrinter - Simplified. No longer includes a list of all
	puzzles; nor does it include difficulty sliders. Instead, we have
	a simpler, checkbox-style interface.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku.py:

	is_valid_puzzle - convenience method to check the validity of a
	puzzle (i.e. crash-proofness). Loaders can use this to avoid
	showing users tracebacks when files have been corrupted.

	sudoku_grid_from_string - convenience method to go from puzzle
	string to grid quickly (this had been included in a SudokuDisplay
	class but should be here as it is more generally useful.

	DifficultyRating - Add dictionaries to make it easy to go from a
	category description ('easy') to an i18n label (_('Easy') to a
	range (0.0-0.35).

	DifficultyRating.value_category - Add convenience method to return
	the name of the "level" (easy, hard, etc)

	get_difficulty_category_name and get_difficulty_category -
	convenience methods for going from float difficulty values to
	category name.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/timer.py:

	format_time - Add "friendly" option which makes short,
	user-friendly time strings.

	format_time_compact - Alternate method of showing user a time in
	00:00:00 format

	format_friendly_date - Format date/times with nice words like "2
	minutes ago", "Yesterday", etc. if the date is recent.

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/saver.py:

	SudokuTracker - move SudokuTracker class here, since it's main
	purpose is now to deal with saved games. Games are saved into a
	~/.sudoku/ directory. Finished games are moved into a finished
	folder (in case we ever want to reimplement high scores).

	* gnome-sudoku/src/lib/sudoku_generator_gui.py: Update to use new
	sudoku_maker. Counting puzzles got substantially simpler.

	* gnome-sudoku/data/easy:
	* gnome-sudoku/data/medium:
	* gnome-sudoku/data/hard:
	* gnome-sudoku/data/very_hard: - New starter puzzles
	in new format.

	* gnome-sudoku/glade/print_games.glade: - New slider-less, simplified
	print dialog.

	* gnome-sudoku/glade/select_game.glade: - New open-and-new dialog

2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/game_selector.py Fix display of games that were printed
	and "marked as played" in resume-game dialog.
	* src/lib/timer.py Handle games that don't have proper
	__absolute_start_time__ set gracefully. This is to account for
	games that are printed and marked-as-played, which don't have any
	timer information when they are restored. As a result, we put a
	check into toggle_timing which resets the timer if there is no
	__absolute_start_time__ set.
	* src/lib/saver.py Handle saved games with no tracker information
	(this is to make restoring printed games that were
	marked-as-played workable).
	* src/lib/gsudoku.py Handle games without any in_progress
	information saved. This is to handle restoring games that were
	marked-as-played. This fixes Bug 408787 - crash in Sudoku:
	ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack.
	
2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Fix bug #409472 crash in Sudoku: pressed
	Clear on one of....  This was caused by a bug in
	entry_validate. We've now simplified the find_error routine that
	entry_validate calls so that it will never return None (which
	caused the key error). We also fix a typo in
	SudokuGameDisplay.remove that was causing errors to get
	un-highlighted when they should not be (this error could also have
	caused some bugs in which the game the user sees would not be
	reflected in gnome-sudoku's internal grid, resulting in finished
	games that were not considered finished by gnome-sudoku).
 
	* src/lib/sudoku.py: Change find_conflict method to
	find_conflicts, which will return all conflicts. This fixes bug
	#409472 and also assures we will highlight all conflicts. 

2007-02-25  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: Fix bug #400976 "Sudoku crashes on
	logout with a TypeError exception". We fix this two ways -- first,
	insensitize the clear buttons so that we won't get the clear_cb
	called if there are no trackers selected. Second, add a check to
	clear_cb so that it doesn't give a traceback if for some reason it
	is called with no trackers selected.

2007-02-22  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku.py: Fix bug #409878 "crash in Sudoku:
	clicked on the Fill button", which would raise an exception
	when the fill button is clicked multiple times.

2007-02-16  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

2007-01-27  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py: Prevent exception from occuring when
	clicking on the autofill button, when nothing is selected.
	Closes Bug #400279.

2007-01-15  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Wrap methods that bring up a "swallowed
	dialog" (New Game, etc.) with a decorator that inactivates widgets
	that would lead to a confused state for gnome sudoku (e.g. don't
	allow the user to go two levels deep into "New Game" dialogs,
	don't allow them to "print" a game that isn't visible, etc.). This
	fixes bug #392997.

	Clear history when starting new game or opening game (#388744)
	
	* src/lib/gtk_goodies/Undo.py Add clear() method to undo history
	list.

2007-01-15  Thomas M. Hinkle  <thinkle@cvs.gnome.org>

	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py Use new add_value_to_ui method for
	inserting values in squares on an "undo" of clearing the
	grid. This method will re-insert values whether or not they were
	valid parts of the grid.

	* src/lib/gsudoku.py When clearing the grid, clear all
	user-entered values, whether or not they are part of our internal
	grid (or internal grid doesn't stores values that were invalid
	when entered). Add new add_value_to_ui convenience method for
	adding a value to the entry whether or not its valid. Use
	entry_validate to add previously-conflicting values to our
	internal grid when the conflicting value is deleted; this gives us
	error handling for free in case other conflicts arise (should fix
	bug #396823).
	
2007-01-07  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* gnome-sudoku.desktop.in: Add missing bugzilla stuff.

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* src/lib/sudoku_generator_gui.py: Add a temporary solution
	to the puzzle generator generating more puzzles than asked,
	so that the bug is not visible to the user. This will be fixed 
	"the correct way" during the 2.19.x development cycle. Patch 
	from Thomas Andersen in Bug #392165. 

2007-01-05  Andreas Røsdal  <andreasr@gnome.org>

	* images/footprints.png: Used shoe-prints. Note that if we get a
	real artist to pretty up this icon, it needs to contain mostly
	solid black that will gets properly re-colored when we add
	trackers of different colors.
	* src/lib/gnome_sudoku.py: Tweak our fix to Bug 369531; Use
	STOCK_DIALOG_INFO instead of STOCK_INFO for hints. Make sure
	tracker is off by default.

	* src/lib/gtk_goodies/image_extras.py: Fix re-coloring of black png files.
	* src/lib/saver.py: Don't automatically show trackers just because
	there *are* trackers for a game; rely on the UI to save the
	toggled-state of tracker visibility on its own.
