# GNOME Sudoku

Sudoku is a Japanese logic game that exploded in popularity in 2005.

GNOME Sudoku was originally programmed in Python by Thomas Hinkle, though it has since been rewritten.
It is meant to have an interface as simple and unobstrusive as possible while still providing features that make playing difficult Sudoku more fun.
